            <b>What We Do:</b><br/>
            Pinot's Palette is the upscale paint and sip studio in Denver. Here you can Paint, drink and have fun every time you come! We generally paint on canvas while you sip on your favorite beverage from our bar. At our studio, everyone is an artist - no experience necessary!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Our artist instructors will guide you step by step in creating your very own masterpiece during our two and three hour classes. You can follow their direction, but you're also welcome to let your creative juices flow and do your own thing on the canvas! Our classes are anything but boring! Good music, good drinks and good people will make your experience one you won't forget!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            We'd love to help you plan and celebrate your next night out, date night, birthday, bachelorette party, sprinkle shower, or anniversary! We also specialize in team building, corporate and special events.
